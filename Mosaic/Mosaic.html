        <p>This visualization aims to help Likert scale questionnaires conceptors to visualize the answers of those tests.
        Each square on the mosaic represent an answer from a respondent to a question and the colour of the square represent
        the answer value.</p>

        <p>The aim of this visualization is to allow the user to see general trends in the answers such as
        "the answer given to question B13 are mostly associated with disagreement" and to examine the answer of
        specific individuals at the same time. It also allow him to check whether the answer trends vary between categories of respondent by filtering
        the displayed respondents.</p>
